## My work:
Crawl paper information from CVPR 2022 and CVPR 2023, including paper titles, author names, and affiliations. Subsequently, pre trained large models are used for information extraction to accurately obtain information about the author and their affiliation. After completing information extraction, analyze the data and display the results in a visual manner.
## Attention:
My API key section has been removed from the code to prevent malicious use of the API key 

Kimiai only allows up to 1000 files to be uploaded, while CVPR 2022 and CVPR2023 have over 4000 papers, so it is necessary to delete files uploaded using Kimiai's API (run kimiai.py to delete them) and then re upload the files
