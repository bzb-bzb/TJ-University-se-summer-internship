## My work:
Crawl paper information from CVPR 2022 and CVPR 2023, including paper titles, author names, and affiliations. Subsequently, pre trained large models are used for information extraction to accurately obtain information about the author and their affiliation. After completing information extraction, analyze the data and display the results in a visual manner.
